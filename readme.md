# Readme Builder

## Description

This project was created to create an application that generated a professional Readme markdown file based off the input by the user. The aim was to reduce the input required from the user be having the layout pre-filled with the correct markdown syntax and additional information depending on certain options that are selected. The project meets the following criteria:

* The application is able to produce a readme file called "generated readme.md" which is stored in the folder where the application is run from.
* The application has the option to choose different license options with T&C's pre-filled depending on the selected option.
* The Inquirer module is used to accept the user's input in the CLI.
* 

The main things I've learned from this project are:

* Gained an understanding of Node.js and how to add and run modules such as Inquirer.
* Learned how to import scripts and packages.

## User Story

```md
AS A web developer
I WANT accurrately produce professional Readme files
SO THAT I can be sure to cover all aspects needed for my projects.
```

## Installation

For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main tool I'll be using is called, Node. Node allows the use of packages such as Inquirer and the ability to run JavaScript without the use of a browser.

## Usage

Once the application is run, the user will be prompted with a series of questions that are relevant to the different sections of the Readme. The answers the user inputs will be used to generate the final Readme file.

The generated readme files are stored in the folder where the application is run.
